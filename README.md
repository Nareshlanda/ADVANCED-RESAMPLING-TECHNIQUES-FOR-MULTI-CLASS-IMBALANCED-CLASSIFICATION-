This project focuses on addressing the challenges of imbalanced classification by implementing and evaluating advanced resampling techniques across three real-world datasets: Breast Cancer, Churn BigML, and CRX Credit Approval. The study explores the limitations of traditional machine-learning models when trained on skewed data and investigates how techniques such as SMOTE, ADASYN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), KMeans-based resampling, and their hybrid combinations can improve class balance and predictive performance. Each dataset undergoes preprocessing, resampling, and classification using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, followed by a detailed comparison of key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The results show that hybrid approaches—particularly GMM-ADASYN and KMeans-SMOTE—consistently enhance minority-class detection while reducing bias toward majority classes. Overall, the project demonstrates that thoughtfully applied advanced resampling methods significantly improve model robustness, making them highly effective solutions for real-world applications where class imbalance is unavoidable.
